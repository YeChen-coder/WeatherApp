# Project Brief: Weather Information Platform

## Vision Statement
Create an intelligent weather information platform that not only provides accurate real-time weather data but anticipates user needs and guides them through location validation, data persistence, and comprehensive weather insights for travel planning and location analysis.

## Problem Statement [discovery-critical: problem-validation]
**Primary Problem**: Users need reliable, real-time weather information for multiple locations, with the ability to track historical queries, compare weather patterns across date ranges, and make informed decisions about travel or relocation.

**Context**: This is a technical assessment project demonstrating:
- API integration capabilities (weather data retrieval)
- Input validation and user guidance (location formats, date ranges)
- Database design and CRUD operations
- Multi-API orchestration (weather, maps, video content)
- Data export functionality (multiple formats)

**Why it matters**: Showcases full-stack development skills including frontend UX, backend API integration, database design, and data transformation capabilities required for AI/ML application development.

## Target Users [discovery-critical: user-clarity]

### Primary User: Technical Assessment Reviewers
- **Needs**: Clear demonstration of technical competence across frontend, backend, database, and API integration
- **Context**: Evaluating candidate for Software Engineer Intern - AI/ML Application role
- **Constraints**: 5-day timeline, must include demo video and documentation

### Secondary User: End Users (Simulated)
- **Travelers**: Planning trips and needing multi-day weather forecasts
- **Location Researchers**: Comparing weather patterns across locations and time periods
- **Data Exporters**: Need weather data in various formats for analysis

## Core Value Proposition [discovery-critical: value-definition]
**Unique Value**:
1. **Flexible Location Input**: Accepts zip codes, GPS coordinates, landmarks, cities - system handles validation
2. **Date Range Analysis**: Not just current weather, but historical and forecast data across user-specified ranges
3. **Data Persistence**: Save queries for future reference and comparison
4. **Multi-Source Enrichment**: Weather + location videos + maps for comprehensive location understanding
5. **Export Flexibility**: JSON, XML, CSV, PDF, Markdown outputs for diverse use cases

**Why Choose This**: Demonstrates thinking beyond basic requirements - anticipates user needs like "what else should I know about this location?" and "how can I use this data elsewhere?"

## Domain Context

### Weather API Landscape
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Free tier available, comprehensive weather data
- **WeatherAPI.com**: Good free tier with forecast data
- **NOAA APIs**: US-focused, government data, highly reliable

- **Response Time**: <2s for weather data retrieval, <1s for database operations

## Technical Considerations [discovery-critical: technical-viability]

### Development Philosophy
- **User-Centric Validation**: Guide users to successful inputs rather than just rejecting invalid ones
- **Resilience**: Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns (API layer, business logic, data layer, UI)
- **Demonstrability**: Code should be easy to review and understand

### Deployment Context
- **Scale**: Single-user demonstration (no need for multi-tenancy)
- **Users**: Assessment reviewers accessing via web
- **Environment**: **AWS Ubuntu EC2 instance (production deployment required)**
- **Constraints**:
  - 5-day development timeline
  - Free-tier API limitations
  - Must deploy to AWS Ubuntu server
  - Must be accessible via public URL for demo

### Integration Landscape
**Required Integrations**:
- Weather API (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.com, or similar)
- Database (SQL: PostgreSQL/MySQL or NoSQL: MongoDB)

**Optional but Valuable**:
- YouTube Data API (location videos)
- Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap (map display, geocoding)
- Additional creative APIs

## Project Constraints

### Timeline
- **Submission Deadline**: 5 days from assessment receipt
- **Milestone 1**: Tech Assessment 1 complete (Day 2-3)
- **Milestone 2**: Tech Assessment 2 features (Day 4-5)
- **Final Day**: Testing, demo video, documentation

### Technical
- **Technology Stack**: Autonomous choice (demonstrates decision-making)
- **Database**: Must support CRUD operations effectively
- **APIs**: Must use real APIs (no static data)
- **GitHub**: Public repository or PMA-Community collaboration access

### Deliverables
- GitHub repository (public or shared with PMA-Community)
- README with setup instructions and feature documentation
- Requirements file (dependencies)
- Demo video (1-2 minutes, screen recording)
- Application includes candidate name and PM Accelerator info button

## Risk Factors [discovery-helpful: risk-awareness]

### Technical Risks
1. **API Rate Limits**: Free tiers may have restrictive limits
   - *Mitigation*: Cache responses, implement rate limiting on client side

2. **Location Parsing Complexity**: Multiple input formats (zip, GPS, landmarks, cities)
   - *Mitigation*: Use geocoding API for validation, fuzzy matching

3. **Date Range Validation**: Historical vs forecast data availability varies by API
   - *Mitigation*: Clear API capability documentation, graceful error messages

4. **Database Schema Evolution**: CRUD requirements may reveal schema issues late
   - *Mitigation*: Design schema upfront with Tech Assessment 2 in mind

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Optional features could consume excessive time
   - *Mitigation*: Prioritize Tech Assessment 1 completion, then add Tech Assessment 2 features incrementally

2. **API Integration Delays**: Unexpected API issues
   - *Mitigation*: Test API integrations early, have backup API options

3. **AWS Deployment Complexity**: Infrastructure setup could consume development time
   - *Mitigation*: Use infrastructure-as-code approach, test deployment early, document all steps

### Presentation Risks
1. **Demo Video Quality**: Poor demo could undersell working code
   - *Mitigation*: Script demo flow, rehearse before recording

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Included
- **User Authentication**: Single-user demonstration, no login required
- **Row-Level Security**: Assessment explicitly states this is not necessary
- **Production Deployment**: Local development only
- **Mobile Optimization**: Desktop-first acceptable (though responsive is bonus)
- **Elaborate UI Design**: Assessment states designers will handle polish
- **Real-Time Updates**: Polling/websockets not required
- **Internationalization**: English interface acceptable

## Open Questions

### Technical Decisions
1. **Technology Stack** (Must support AWS Ubuntu deployment):
   - Frontend: React/Vue/Svelte vs server-rendered (Next.js/SvelteKit)?
   - Backend: Node.js/Python/Go?
   - Database: PostgreSQL (local) vs AWS RDS vs MongoDB?
   - Web Server: Nginx + PM2 vs Docker containers?

2. **Location Input Strategy**:
   - Single input field with intelligent parsing?
   - Multiple input fields (zip, city, GPS) with tabs?
   - How aggressive should fuzzy matching be?

3. **Date Range Handling**:
   - Should we combine historical + current + forecast APIs?
   - How to handle date ranges spanning past/future boundary?
   - What's the max reasonable date range?

4. **Database Schema**:
   - Store raw API responses vs normalized weather data?
   - How to handle location variations (NYC vs New York City vs 10001)?
   - Should we deduplicate identical queries?

### User Experience
1. **Current Location**: Use browser geolocation API or manual entry?
2. **Weather Icons**: Custom graphics vs weather API icons vs emoji?
3. **Error Messages**: How detailed should location validation feedback be?

### Assessment Strategy
1. **Which features demonstrate most value**: Focus on Tech Assessment 1 polish vs Tech Assessment 2 breadth?
2. **Code organization**: Monorepo vs separate frontend/backend?
3. **Testing**: Unit tests required or just functional demo?
