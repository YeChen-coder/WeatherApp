# Development Process Documentation

This folder contains the planning and design documents created during the development of the Weather Information Platform.

## Document Overview

### 01-Tech-Assessment-Requirements.md
**Purpose**: Original technical assessment requirements from PM Accelerator
- Tech Assessment 1: Basic weather app with location input and 5-day forecast
- Tech Assessment 2: Advanced features including CRUD operations, API integrations, and data export
- Submission requirements and evaluation criteria

### 02-Project-Brief.md
**Purpose**: High-level project vision and context
- Problem statement and vision
- Target users (technical reviewers and end users)
- Core value proposition
- Success metrics
- Technical considerations and deployment requirements

### 03-Product-Requirements.md
**Purpose**: Detailed functional requirements organized as epics and user stories
- Epic 1: Location-Based Weather Retrieval
- Epic 2: Date Range Weather Queries (Historical + Forecast)
- Epic 3: CRUD Operations
- Epic 4: Weather Condition Icons
- Epic 5: Data Export (Optional)
- Epic 6: API Integration - YouTube Videos (Optional)
- Acceptance criteria and technical notes for each story

### 04-Architecture-Design.md
**Purpose**: System architecture and technical design decisions
- Architecture pattern selection (N-Tier Monolith)
- System component breakdown
- Data model design (PostgreSQL schema)
- API endpoint specifications
- Technology stack justification
- Deployment architecture (AWS Ubuntu EC2)

### 05-Research-Findings.md
**Purpose**: Research on weather APIs, geocoding services, and implementation approaches
- Weather API comparison (Open-Meteo, OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.com)
- Geocoding service evaluation (Geoapify, Google Maps)
- Database design considerations
- Export format options

### 06-Development-Journal.md
**Purpose**: Day-by-day development log tracking decisions, progress, and challenges
- Development timeline and milestones
- Implementation decisions and rationale
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- Features completed and pending

## How These Documents Were Used

1. **Planning Phase** (Day 1):
   - Analyzed technical assessment requirements
   - Created project brief to establish vision
   - Researched API options and evaluated trade-offs

2. **Design Phase** (Day 1-2):
   - Wrote PRD with detailed user stories
   - Designed system architecture
   - Documented API specifications and data models

3. **Implementation Phase** (Day 2-5):
   - Used user stories as implementation checklist
   - Followed architecture design for code organization
   - Kept development journal for decision tracking

4. **Deployment Phase** (Day 5):
   - Used architecture docs for AWS deployment
   - Verified all acceptance criteria met

## Technology Stack (As Documented)

**Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
**Backend**: Next.js API Routes (serverless functions)
**Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
**APIs**:
- Open-Meteo (Weather data)
- Geoapify (Geocoding)
- YouTube Data API v3 (Optional - Location videos)

**Deployment**: AWS Ubuntu EC2 + Nginx + PM2

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Next.js over Django/Flask**: Faster development, better React integration, simpler deployment
2. **PostgreSQL over MongoDB**: Better for structured data with relationships, JSONB support for flexibility
3. **Open-Meteo over OpenWeatherMap**: Unlimited free tier, no API key required
4. **Geoapify over Google Maps**: Higher free tier (3000 req/day), simpler setup
5. **Server-side rendering**: Better initial load performance, simpler state management

## Lessons Learned

- **BMAD Method**: Using personas (PM, Architect, Developer) helped break down complex requirements systematically
- **Documentation First**: Writing PRD before coding prevented scope creep and clarified requirements
- **API Selection**: Researching APIs upfront saved time - avoided hitting rate limits mid-development
- **Incremental Development**: Completing Tech Assessment 1 first, then adding advanced features worked well

## Next Steps (If Continuing Project)

- [ ] Add Google Maps integration for location visualization
- [ ] Implement user authentication and query ownership
- [ ] Add weather alerts/notifications
- [ ] Create mobile-responsive PWA
- [ ] Add comparison view for multiple locations
- [ ] Implement caching layer for API responses
